## What is Page Object Model (POM)?
Page Object Model is a design pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. A page object is an object-oriented class that serves as an interface to a page.
The tests then use the methods of this page object class whenever they need to interact with the UI of that page, the benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves donâ€™t need to be changed, only the code within the page object needs to change.
Subsequently all changes to support that new UI are located in one place.
